## Detailed Breakdown: Evening Panel (8:00 – 10:00 PM)

**"Anonymity: The Spiritual Foundation of AA Unity"** — 120 minutes (uses Slides 24–35 of the HTML presentation)

| Time | Min | Slide | Section | Key Content |
|------|-----|-------|---------|-------------|
| 8:00 | 5 | 24 | **Panel Introduction** | Welcome back, evening format explained, ground rules ("what's shared here stays here"), connection to homegroup theme: "Your home group is where you first learn to practice anonymity" |
| 8:05 | 10 | 25 | **The Foundation: Why Anonymity?** | Three reasons anonymity exists: (1) Personal protection from stigma, (2) Organizational protection from personalities, (3) Spiritual practice of humility; what anonymity is NOT (secrecy, loophole for bad behavior); how it shows up in home groups |
| 8:15 | 10 | 26 | **Historical Evolution** | Timeline: 1935–1939 (safety from stigma), 1939–1941 (Cleveland Plain Dealer break, Jack Alexander article respected anonymity), 1944 (Bill W.'s break), 1946 (Traditions codified), 1955–present (digital age challenges); Esther E. connection: her story came through the respectful Saturday Evening Post article |
| 8:25 | 15 | 27 | **The Two Levels of Anonymity** | CRITICAL DISTINCTION: Personal level (your choice who knows) vs. Public media level (protected); examples: talking to boss (OK), Facebook post with full name (NOT OK), Zoom meetings (gray area), celebrity disclosures (break); home group application |
| 8:40 | 15 | 28 | **Tradition Eleven Deep Dive** | "Attraction rather than promotion" — what it means, why it matters; Washingtonian Society cautionary tale; personal anonymity at level of press/radio/films/TV/internet; modern applications: social media, podcasts, blogs; common Q&A |
| 8:55 | 15 | 29 | **Tradition Twelve Deep Dive** | "Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions"; principles before personalities explained with real examples (long-winded speaker, wealthy donor, popular leader, celebrity member); spiritual discipline: humility, equality, protection from ego, unity; home group practices |
| 9:10 | 10 | 30 | **Anonymity vs. Confidentiality** | KEY: Anonymity = your own identity; Confidentiality = others' presence/stories; "Who you see here, what you hear here, when you leave here, let it stay here"; scenarios: seeing boss at meeting, telling spouse what someone shared, celebrity attendance, relapse gossip |
| 9:20 | 15 | 31 | **Digital Age Challenges** | Social media breaks (Facebook anniversaries, Instagram meeting selfies, location check-ins, Zoom screenshots, recovery blogs using full names, LinkedIn endorsements); best practices for individuals and home groups; sample technology policy |
| 9:35 | 10 | 32 | **Anonymity & Your Home Group** | Practical applications: rotating service positions, equal voice in group conscience, conference-approved literature only, first names only, no crosstalk, no promotion/recognition; connecting to morning theme "where it all begins"; action items checklist; 5-minute open sharing |
| 9:45 | 10 | 33 | **Common Anonymity Breaks & Solutions** | Real scenarios with loving correction approach: member posts meeting photo, gossips about relapse, newcomer doesn't understand, old-timer dominates, secret recording, media inquiry; when to involve group conscience |
| 9:55 | 15 | 34 | **Panel Discussion Prompts** | Open floor discussion with 10 prompts (personal anonymity decisions, digital age challenges, attraction vs. promotion, principles before personalities, confidentiality in practice, celebrity anonymity, home group practices, gray areas, sponsorship, looking forward); 15-minute timer for sharing |
| 10:10 | 5 | 35 | **Literature & Closing** | Comprehensive reference table (12&12, Big Book, Understanding Anonymity pamphlet, AA Comes of Age, Language of the Heart, etc.); action plan (this week, this month, this year); connection to full-day theme; Responsibility Statement; final thank yous |
