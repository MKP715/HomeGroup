- **What to read** (exact quotes to read aloud — marked with a book icon)
- **What to do** (activities, audience engagement, timing cues)
- **Scenario prompts** (real-world situations for group discussion)
- **Transition language** (how to move smoothly to the next section)

**Timing:** 120 minutes for presentation. Activities add ~30–40 minutes of attendee participation for a total of ~150+ minutes.

## SLIDE 0: Title / Hero (5 minutes)

### What to Do
- Stand center. Welcome everyone warmly.
- Open with the **Serenity Prayer** (ask everyone to stand).
- After the prayer, introduce yourself: first name, alcoholic, your home group name, and your service position.

### Talking Points
- "Welcome to the District 22 Mini Conference here at Los Tres Patrillos in Greenville on this beautiful April 4th. We are part of NETA Area 65 — the North East Texas Area — one of 93 Areas in the AA General Service structure."
- "Today's theme is **Home Group: Where It All Begins.** Everything we're going to explore today comes from AA Conference-approved literature — the Big Book, the Twelve and Twelve, the AA pamphlets, the Service Manual, and more."
- "This isn't a lecture — it's a workshop. I'm going to ask you to participate, share, discuss, and think. The best insights today will come from you, not from me."

### Quick Engagement
- "Before we dive in — by show of hands: **How many of you have a home group?**" (Pause, look around, acknowledge.)
- "Keep your hands up if you **currently hold a service position** in your home group." (Note the drop.)
- "The 2022 AA Membership Survey found that 89% of members have a home group. Let's explore why that number is so high — and why it matters."

### Transition
- "Let's begin." (Click to Slide 1)

## SLIDE 1: Opening & Workshop Overview (10 minutes)

### What to Read (slowly, with weight)
> 📖 *"Traditionally, most A.A. members through the years have found it important to belong to one group that they call their 'home group.' This is the group where they accept service responsibilities and try to sustain friendships."* — P-16, page 15

### Talking Points
- Walk through the three major themes of the workshop (displayed on screen):
  1. **History & Origins** — Where did the home group concept come from?
  2. **Spiritual & Practical Benefits** — Why does belonging matter?
  3. **Service & Structure** — How does the home group connect us to all of AA?
- Point out the literature sources listed on screen. "Everything I share today has a page number. This isn't my opinion — it's what our literature says."
- "We have copies of P-16 'The A.A. Group' and P-15 'Sponsorship Q&A' on the literature table. If you've never read them, I'd encourage you to pick one up today."

### Activity: Opening Show of Hands (2 minutes)
- "How many of you have been to your home group's most recent **business meeting**?"
- "How many of you know who your **GSR** is?"
- "How many of you know what **District 22** does?"
- (Don't comment on the numbers judgmentally — just note them.) "By the end of today, you'll understand why all three of those questions matter for your sobriety."

### Transition
- "To understand why the home group matters so deeply, we need to go back to the beginning. Not to a committee meeting or a rulebook — but to a living room in Akron, Ohio."

---

## SLIDE 2: Historical Evolution (15 minutes)

### Setting the Scene
- "The term 'home group' does **not** appear in the Big Book. It doesn't appear in the Twelve and Twelve. It emerged organically from decades of fellowship practice. The word showed up in the early 1990s. But the *reality* of the home group existed from Day One."

### Timeline Talking Points

**1935–1939: The Smith Home**
- "Picture this: 855 Ardmore Avenue, Akron, Ohio. Dr. Bob and Anne Smith's house. This was AA before AA had a name. Bill W. lived there for months after his first meeting with Dr. Bob."
- "Meetings included 'quiet time, prayer, and Bible readings.' Anne Smith led morning readings from the Book of James. Members even hospitalized new prospects before letting them attend meetings — that's how seriously they took early support."

> 📖 *Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers, page 101*

- "This was the prototype. Not a meeting in a church basement with folding chairs — a home. A family. That's what the home group still is."

**May 1939: Cleveland**
- "The first group to actually use the name 'Alcoholics Anonymous.' Clarence S. wrote to Bill W. describing their approach:"

> 📖 *"Not too much emphasis on spiritual business at meetings. Have discussions after meetings of any business or questions arising. Plenty of fellowship all the time."* — Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers, p. 167

- "Notice that balance: spiritual foundation AND social fellowship. That's still the recipe for a healthy home group."

**1940: The Akron Manual**
- "This is the earliest documented use of 'home group' language — written by 'Dr. Bob's Home Group, Akron AA group #1.'"
- "It said: *'Meetings provide a means for an exchange of ideas, the renewing of fellowships... a sense of security'* and *'Remember that attendance at meetings is one of the most important requisites of remaining sober.'*"

**1993 & 2000: Formal Recognition**
- "It took until 1993 for the Grapevine to publish a book called 'The Home Group.' In 2000, it became a permanent department in the magazine. The 30th Anniversary Edition now includes content on virtual meetings."
- "The lesson: **AA doesn't impose from the top down. Practices emerge from group experience, get refined over decades, and eventually get written down.** That's Tradition Two in action."

### Scenario Prompt (for audience)
- "Think about your own home group's history. When was it founded? Who started it? Does anyone know? *That story matters.* Every home group has an origin story, and it's worth learning yours."

### Discussion Prompt (on screen — 2 minutes)
- "The term 'home group' emerged organically from decades of practice, not from a rule book. **What does this tell us about how AA works?**"
- Let 2-3 people share briefly from the floor.

### Transition
- "So we know where the concept came from. But what actually *makes* a home group different from just going to meetings? Let's look at what P-16 tells us."

---

## SLIDE 3: What Distinguishes a Home Group (10 minutes)

### Key Concept
- "This is the slide that makes some people uncomfortable — because it draws a clear line between *attending* meetings and *belonging* to a home group."

### What to Read
> 📖 *"A.A. groups generally continue to exist outside the prescribed meeting hours, ready to provide Twelfth Step help when needed."* — P-16, pages 12–13

> 📖 *"Just as we are members of A.A. if we say we are, so are we members of a group if we say we are."* — P-16, page 13

- "No application. No dues. No committee vote. You declare yourself a member. That's Tradition Three."

### Three Elements — Walk Through Each Card
1. **Accountability**: "At your home group, people *notice* when you're not there. That's not surveillance — that's love."
2. **Service**: "This is where you learn that making coffee can save your life. Living Sober calls these services 'the sturdy backbone of our recovery' (pp. 14–15)."
3. **Voting**: "This is the one most people don't think about. When you're a home group member, you get to **vote**. On format changes, on spending, on who your GSR is. Your voice matters in how AA runs."

### Scenario: "The Floating Member"
- "Here's a real situation: A member has been sober 5 years. They attend meetings 4–5 nights a week at different locations. They know people everywhere. But they don't have a home group. They've never voted in a business meeting. They've never held a service position. **What are they missing?**"
- Let 2–3 people respond from the floor.

### Table Discussion (3 minutes — use timer)
- "Turn to the people near you. Which of these three elements — accountability, service, or voting — has been most meaningful in YOUR recovery? Share briefly."

### Transition
- "Now that we know what makes a home group special, let's look at what it actually *gives* us — spiritually, socially, and practically."

---

## SLIDE 4: Spiritual & Practical Benefits (15 minutes)

### Emotional Core
- "This is the heart of the presentation. These are the quotes that answer the question: *Why does belonging matter?*"

### What to Read — Slowly, With Pauses

**Spiritual:**
> 📖 *"THE unity of Alcoholics Anonymous is the most cherished quality our Society has. Our lives, the lives of all to come, depend squarely upon it."* — 12&12, page 129

- "Let that land. *Our lives depend on it.* Unity isn't a nice idea — it's a survival mechanism."

> 📖 *"The moment Twelfth Step work forms a group, a discovery is made — that most individuals cannot recover unless there is a group."* — As Bill Sees It, page 9

**Fellowship:**
> 📖 *"We are people who normally would not mix. But there exists among us a fellowship, a friendliness, and an understanding which is indescribably wonderful. We are like the passengers of a great liner the moment after rescue from shipwreck when camaraderie, joyousness and democracy pervade the vessel from steerage to Captain's table."* — Big Book, page 17

- "I love that metaphor. We're all survivors of the same shipwreck. The home group is the lifeboat where we found each other."

**Loneliness:**
> 📖 *"Almost without exception, alcoholics are tortured by loneliness."* — As Bill Sees It, page 90

- (Pause here. Let the room feel it.) "Raise your hand if you felt profoundly alone before you got sober." (Don't force it — just offer the space.)
- "The home group is the antidote to that loneliness. Not just meetings — *belonging.*"

**Practical:**
> 📖 *"Over the years, the very essence of A.A. strength has remained with our home group, which, for many members, becomes our extended family."* — P-16

### Pair & Share Activity (5 minutes — use timer)
- "Turn to the person next to you. Share one thing: **'What has your home group given you that you could not have gotten by just attending meetings?'**"
- After timer: ask 2–3 volunteers to share with the whole room.

### Transition
- "The home group doesn't just benefit us — it's the place where sponsorship relationships take root and grow. Let's look at that connection."

---

## SLIDE 5: Sponsorship Connection (10 minutes)

### Key Concept
- "Sponsorship and the home group are symbiotic. Each strengthens the other. P-15 'Questions and Answers on Sponsorship' makes this explicit."

### Talking Points
- "A sponsor's job includes guiding newcomers TO the home group. The home group's job is to create an environment where sponsorship can flourish."
- Walk through the two cards on screen (Guiding Newcomers / Service Sponsorship).

### What to Read
> 📖 *"Active sponsorship programs within a group remind all members of the group's primary purpose. They serve to unite a group and keep it mindful of First Things First."* — P-15, pages 23–25

### Scenario: "The Newcomer at the Door"
- "Picture this: Someone walks into your home group for the very first time. They're shaking. They don't know anyone. They sit in the back. The meeting starts. The meeting ends. Nobody talks to them. They leave. **They never come back.** How many of us have seen this happen?"
- "Now picture the alternative: A greeter meets them at the door. Introduces them to three people. Someone hands them a phone list. After the meeting, two members invite them for coffee. One offers to be a temporary sponsor."
- "**Which of those two scenarios reflects our primary purpose?** The home group is where Tradition Five lives or dies."

### Scenario: "The Service Sponsor"
- "How many of you have heard the term 'service sponsor'? It's someone who guides you through the service structure — not the Steps, but the Traditions, the Concepts, and how to be a trusted servant. P-15 recommends that service sponsorship begins in the home group with simple things: coffee, literature, cleanup."

### Transition
- "And that brings us to the full picture of home group service — from making coffee to representing your group at the General Service Conference."

---

## SLIDE 6: Service Positions (12 minutes)

### What to Read
> 📖 *"Helping others is the foundation stone of your recovery. A kindly act once in a while isn't enough. You have to act the Good Samaritan every day, if need be."* — Big Book, page 97

### Interactive Engagement
- Go through the checklist on screen. Ask attendees to raise hands:
  - "Who has made coffee for their group?" (Most hands.)
  - "Who has been a greeter?"
  - "Secretary?"
  - "Treasurer?"
  - "GSR?" (Fewer hands — note this.)
  - "Intergroup rep?"
  - "Has anyone served on an area committee?"
- "Notice how the hands drop as we move through the positions. That's not a criticism — it's an invitation. There are service positions waiting for you."

### Walk Through the Table
- Briefly describe each role. Emphasize that **suggested sobriety times are suggestions, not requirements.**
- Highlight the GSR: "This is the most important service position in AA that most people have never heard of. We'll talk about why in the next section."

### What to Read
> 📖 *"In A.A., no one is 'above' or 'below' anyone else. There are no classes or strata or hierarchies among the members."* — Living Sober, page 15

- "Making coffee is as spiritually significant as being a delegate. The person who sets up chairs is doing Twelfth Step work."

### Scenario: "The Empty Service Sheet"
- "Your home group has a business meeting. The secretary announces that 4 service positions are open. Nobody volunteers. What happens? The same three people do everything. They burn out. The group suffers. **How do we break this cycle?**"
- Let 2–3 people respond.

### Transition
- "Every one of those service positions exists within a larger structure. Let's look at where YOUR home group sits in the big picture of AA."

---

## SLIDE 7: AA Service Structure (10 minutes)

### Key Visual: The Inverted Pyramid
- "This is the single most important diagram in AA. Look at it. **The groups are on top.** Not the Board. Not New York. Not the Conference. The GROUPS."

### What to Read
> 📖 *"Alcoholics Anonymous has been called an upside-down organization because... the groups are on top and the [service entities] are at the bottom."* — AA Service Manual, page S15

### Walk Through Each Level
- "A.A. Groups — that's your home group. Ultimate authority."
- "GSRs — that's your elected representative."
- "Districts — that's us, District 22."
- "Area Assemblies — that's NETA 65, the North East Texas Area. We're one of 93 areas."
- "General Service Conference — 93 delegates meet annually to make decisions for all of AA."
- "General Service Board, AAWS, Grapevine — they serve US. Not the other way around."

### How Ideas Travel
- Walk through the two cards on screen. Give a concrete example:
- "Let's say your home group thinks AA needs better literature for young people. Here's what happens: You bring it up at a business meeting. Your group discusses it. If the group supports it, your GSR carries it to District 22. The DCM brings it to the NETA 65 area committee. If the area supports it, the delegate takes it to the General Service Conference. And Conference action flows back through the same path."
- "**Every single AA member, through their home group, can influence AA's worldwide policies.** That's not theory — that's how it actually works."

### Scenario: "The Disconnected Group"
- "A home group has been meeting for 10 years. They have no GSR. They don't send anyone to district. They've never heard of the area assembly. When Conference actions change AA literature, they find out months later by accident. **Is that group truly fulfilling its responsibilities?** What Tradition speaks to this?"
- (Answer: Tradition One — common welfare. Tradition Two — participating in the group conscience of AA as a whole. Tradition Nine — AA should remain organized.)

### Transition
- "The Traditions are the spiritual principles that hold this whole structure together. Let's look at the five that most directly shape your home group."

---

## SLIDE 8: The Twelve Traditions (15 minutes)

### Setup
- "Click each tradition card on screen to expand the details. I want to go through five Traditions that are the backbone of home group life."

### Walk Through Each Tradition

**Tradition One — Unity**
> 📖 *"Without unity, the heart of A.A. would cease to beat; our world arteries would no longer carry the life-giving grace of God."* — 12&12, page 129

- "This isn't abstract. When your home group is divided by personality conflicts or competing agendas, people stop coming. Newcomers don't feel welcome. The group dies. And when a group dies, people die."

**Tradition Two — Group Conscience**
> 📖 *"Harder still to accept was the now proven fact that the conscience of the group, when properly informed of the facts and issues and principles involved, was often wiser than any leader, self-appointed or not."* — Bill W., AA Comes of Age, page 99

- "This is radical. Even Bill W. — the co-founder — submitted to group conscience. We'll see a powerful example of this in the next section."

**Tradition Three — Membership**
- "The only requirement is a desire to stop drinking. Period. Not sobriety. Not belief in God. Not good behavior. *Desire.*"
- "This means your home group cannot kick someone out for relapsing, for being difficult, or for having different beliefs. That's hard sometimes. And it's essential."

**Tradition Four — Autonomy**
- "Your home group gets to decide its own format, its own rules, its own character — as long as it doesn't harm other groups or AA as a whole."
- "That's why no two home groups are alike. Big Book meetings. Speaker meetings. Step studies. Discussion meetings. Candlelight meetings. Each reflects Tradition Four in action."

**Tradition Five — Primary Purpose**
> 📖 *"'Shoemaker, stick to thy last!'...better do one thing supremely well than many badly."* — 12&12, page 150

- "When your home group starts drifting into therapy discussions, relationship advice, or political debates, Tradition Five is the compass that brings you back. **We have one job: carry the message to the alcoholic who still suffers.**"

### Group Activity (5 minutes — use timer)
- "At your table: Which of these five Traditions has your home group struggled with the MOST? Share with your table and identify one concrete example. You have 5 minutes."
- After timer: ask 2–3 tables to report briefly.

### Transition
- "Tradition Two introduced the idea of group conscience. Let's look at how that actually works in practice — because this is one of the most unique and powerful aspects of AA."

---

## SLIDE 9: Informed Group Conscience (10 minutes)

### What to Read
> 📖 *"The 'group conscience' is the collective conscience of the group membership and thus represents substantial unanimity on an issue before definitive action is taken. This is achieved by the group members through the sharing of full information, individual points of view, and the practice of A.A. principles. To be fully 'informed' requires a willingness to listen to minority opinions with an open mind."* — P-16, pages 28–30

### Walk Through the Five Elements
- Click each expandable element on screen. Emphasize:
  - **"Substantial unanimity"** — not 51%. Most groups use two-thirds. Some issues need more.
  - **"Minority opinions"** — this is critical. After a vote, the minority is ASKED to share why they voted differently. Sometimes the group changes its mind.
  - **"Deliberation time"** — "If it's a big decision, table it. Come back next month. Let people pray and think. There's no rush."

### The Bill W. Story — Read It
> 📖 *"'Bill, haven't you often said right here in this meeting that sometimes the good is the enemy of the best? Well, this is a plain case of it. You can't do this thing to us!' So spoke the group conscience. The group was right and I was wrong... Here was the true voice, welling up out of my friends. I listened and — thank God — I obeyed."* — AA Comes of Age, page 101

- "If group conscience can overrule the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, it can overrule anyone. That's the beauty of Tradition Two."

### Scenario: "The Controversial Proposal"
- "Your home group business meeting. A member proposes changing the meeting format from speaker to discussion. Another member proposes adding meditation time. A third wants to allow non-conference-approved literature. Each of these requires an informed group conscience."
- "Walk through how you'd handle the non-conference-approved literature proposal. What information would you gather? What Traditions are relevant? How would you ensure all voices are heard?"
- Let the room discuss briefly (2 minutes).

### Scenario: "The Dominant Personality"
- "One member talks the most at every business meeting. They've been sober 20 years. When they speak, newer members go quiet. How does your home group handle this while honoring Tradition Two?"

### Transition
- "All of this — the Traditions, the structure, the service, the spiritual benefits — it all comes together in the choice of where to make your home. Let's talk about choosing wisely."

---

## SLIDE 10: Choosing a Home Group (8 minutes)

### Talking Points
- "Living Sober, Chapter 29, pages 75–81, advises newcomers to try different meetings before settling. This is good advice. Don't marry the first meeting you attend."
- Walk through the three consideration cards on screen (Practical, Fellowship, Service).
- "I always suggest people ask themselves three questions:
  1. **Do I want what these people have?** (Do they seem genuinely happy and sober?)
  2. **Can I get there consistently?** (Practical reality matters.)
  3. **Can I grow here?** (Both in recovery and in service.)"

### What to Read
> 📖 *"The home group is where recovery begins; it is where AA members grow up in sobriety by the time-honored process of trial and error, to discover that they can be loved, warts and all."* — Grapevine, "Home Group: Heartbeat of AA"

- "'Warts and all.' That's the key phrase. Your home group doesn't love the polished, performing version of you. They love the real you — the one who shows up tired, angry, confused, afraid, and imperfect."

### Scenario: "The New Member's Dilemma"
- "A member with 90 days of sobriety attends three different meetings each week. They like all three. Their sponsor says they need a home group. How should they decide?"
- Quick audience response (2 minutes).

### Transition
- "Of course, no home group is perfect. Every group faces challenges. Let's look at the common ones and what the Traditions tell us about addressing them."

---

## SLIDE 11: Common Challenges (10 minutes)

### Framing
- "Every home group struggles. That's not a sign of failure — it's a sign of life. A group that never faces challenges is a group that isn't doing anything."
- "The Traditions already contain the solutions to these problems. We just have to apply them."

### Walk Through Each Challenge Card
- For each, ask: "Has your home group experienced this?" (Show of hands.)
- **Dominant personalities** — Tradition 2. "The solution isn't to silence anyone. It's to create structures where all voices are heard equally."
- **Cliques** — Tradition 3. "The antidote is intentional inclusion. Assign greeters. Move chairs into a circle. Invite newcomers to sit with different people."
- **Outside issues** — Traditions 6 & 10. "This is getting harder in a polarized world. Our meetings are the ONE place where we set all that aside."
- **Financial challenges** — Tradition 7. "Transparency. Regular reports. Education about where 7th Tradition money goes."
- **Apathy** — "This is the silent killer. The cure is demonstrating that service IS recovery."

### Small Group Activity (7 minutes — use timer)
- "In small groups: Pick ONE challenge your home group currently faces. Using the Traditions as your guide, brainstorm ONE concrete action your group could take this month. Be specific. Report back in 5 minutes."
- After timer: Each group reports (2 min each, pick 3–4 groups).

### Transition
- "Let me close the presentation portion with the words that capture everything we've discussed today."

---

## SLIDE 12: Key Quotations & Reflection (10 minutes)

### How to Present
- "I want to read these slowly. No commentary. Just the words. Let them land."
- Consider asking volunteers to read each quote aloud. (Ask beforehand if possible.)
- Pause 5–10 seconds between each quote.

### Read Each Quote
Read all seven quotes on screen, slowly and with feeling. The most important ones:

> 📖 Big Book, page 89: *"Life will take on new meaning..."*

- (Pause.) "That's the promise of the home group."

> 📖 Dr. Bob, page 338: *"Love and service."*

- "Dr. Bob's final message. Three words that contain everything."

> 📖 Big Book, page 164: *"Abandon yourself to God... We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit."*

- "That's the invitation. That's what the home group extends to every person who walks through the door."

> 📖 12&12, page 151: *"It is the great paradox of A.A...."*

- "We keep it by giving it away. And the home group is where we learn to give it away."

### Moment of Silence
- "Let's take 30 seconds of silence to reflect on what we've heard today."

### Transition
- "Let me leave you with the complete literature reference and a final reflection."

---

## SLIDE 13: Literature Guide & Closing (10 minutes)

### Talking Points
- "On your handout, you have every literature reference from today with page numbers. I encourage you to go home and read P-16 'The A.A. Group' from cover to cover. It's one of the most important pieces of AA literature most members have never read."
- Point out the Service Triangle on screen. "Recovery, Unity, Service — and the home group sits right at the center."
- Walk through the reference table briefly.

### Closing Reflection
- Read the closing reflection on screen slowly.
- "The home group is where we learn to give it away — one meeting, one service commitment, one newcomer welcomed, one vote cast in group conscience, one day at a time."

### Personal Commitment Activity (2 minutes — use timer)
- "Take a moment of silence. Consider: **What is ONE action you will take THIS WEEK to strengthen your connection to your home group?**"
- "If you don't have a home group, what meeting will you visit this week as a potential home?"
- "Write it on your handout."

### Close With the Responsibility Statement
- Ask everyone to stand.
- Read together: *"I am responsible. When anyone, anywhere, reaches out for help, I want the hand of A.A. always to be there. And for that: I am responsible."*

### Final Words
- "Thank you for being here. Thank you for caring about your home group. Thank you for caring about AA. District 22 is grateful for your service and your presence today."
- "Let's take a break for lunch, and we'll reconvene at 1:00 PM for our history presentation on how AA came to Dallas and North East Texas."

---

# SEGMENT 2: History Presentation — "How AA Got to Dallas & North East Texas"

**Presenter:** History Presenter (or same presenter as morning session)
**Time:** 1:15 PM – 2:30 PM (75 minutes)
**Slides:** 15–23 of the HTML presentation

**Key Principle:** This isn't a dry history lecture. Every historical fact connects to a principle that attendees can apply TODAY. The stories of these early members ARE the stories of the Traditions before the Traditions were written. Make it personal, make it vivid, and let the audience see themselves in the history.

---

## SLIDE 15: History Title & Welcome Back (5 minutes)

### What to Do
- Welcome everyone back from lunch. Ask everyone to stand.
- Read the **Responsibility Statement** together.
- "This morning we explored what the home group IS. This afternoon we're going to explore where it CAME FROM — right here in Dallas."

### Quick Engagement
- "By show of hands: **How many of you know who Esther E. is?**" (Note response.)
- "**How many know who brought AA to Texas?**"
- "**How many know that Bill Wilson's original sponsor got sober right here in Dallas?**"
- "By the end of this hour, you'll know these names like family — because they ARE our family in sobriety."

### Transition
- "Our story begins not in Dallas but in Cleveland, Ohio — with a man who'd never attended a single AA meeting." (Click next.)

---

## SLIDE 16: Larry J. & Houston — 1940 (10 minutes)

### Setting the Scene
- "Before Dallas could have AA, Texas itself needed the message. And it arrived in the most unlikely way possible."

### What to Say — Larry J.'s Story (paint the picture)
- "Picture this: Cleveland, Ohio, winter of 1939. A newspaper man named Larry Jewell is found in freezing weather with no coat. One lung collapsed from tuberculosis. The other has a tube protruding from his chest. He'd drunk himself into the gutter."
- Let that image land. Pause.
- "The editor of the Cleveland Press, Louis Seltzer, sent a search party to find him and paid for his hospitalization."
- "During his recovery, doctors told him to move to a warmer climate. The night before he left for Texas, his sponsors — Dr. Bob Smith, co-founder of AA, and Clarence Snyder — gave him a Big Book. That's it. One book."
- "On the train to Houston, reading that book, Larry had a spiritual awakening. He described feeling 'all in one piece again.' He arrived in January 1940 determined to help other alcoholics."

### Fun Facts (point to screen)
- "Larry convinced the Houston Press editor to run 6 anonymous articles about AA starting February 8, 1940. Those articles became **the first AA pamphlet ever published** — the only AA literature besides the Big Book until late 1940. The first AA pamphlet was born right here in Texas!"
- "On April 1, 1940, Larry wrote 'The Texas Prayer' — used to open AA meetings throughout Texas for years. Texas had its own identity from Day One."
- "By September 1940, Houston was listed among only 9 'secure' AA groups in the entire United States — alongside Akron, New York, Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C."

### The Cautionary Note
- "But Larry struggled with his leadership style. He ran the Houston group with what they called 'an iron hand.' When the group voted for a steering committee based on Eastern AA practices, Larry pulled out resentfully and relapsed."
- "He returned in 1943 but died later that year from his health conditions."
- "His legacy? The people he helped included a woman named **Esther E.** — who would carry the message to Dallas."

### Transition
- "But before Esther got to Dallas, someone else tried first. And failed spectacularly."

## SLIDE 17: Kent W. — The False Start (10 minutes)

### Opening
- "The history of AA in Dallas does NOT begin with success. It begins with failure — and that failure teaches lessons still relevant today."

### Ruth T.'s Letter
- "The earliest recorded impulse for recovery in Dallas: **Ruth T.**, June 14, 1941, sent a letter to Ruth Hock — Bill Wilson's secretary — asking about AA in her area. A lone woman. No meetings anywhere near her. Think about that desperation. Remember her name."

### Kent W.'s Approach
- "On December 1, 1941, Kent W. arrived in Dallas. Sober from Florida. Public relations background. Aggressive strategy."
- "And he called himself the **'Chief Sponsor'** of Dallas AA." (Pause. Let the title land.)
- "Chief Sponsor. Think about what that means in light of Tradition Two: 'Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.' Kent was governing before the Traditions were even written."
- "He organized a meeting at the White Plaza Hotel — January 7, 1942. Despite severe weather, twelve people came. A Dallas Morning News story generated 72 inquiries. Looked promising."
- Pause. "**The whole thing collapsed entirely.** Kent W. was 'never heard from again.'"

### Interactive — Walk Through the Table
- Point to the comparison table on screen. "Look at this contrast. Hotel vs. living room. Newspaper publicity vs. word of mouth. 'Chief Sponsor' vs. humble service."
- "Which approach sounds more like your home group?"

### Discussion (2 minutes)
- "Turn to your neighbor: Why did Kent's approach fail? What Traditions — even though they hadn't been written yet — was he violating?"
- Let 2-3 people share with the room.

### Transition
- "Kent's failure cleared the ground. And in 1943, a woman arrived who would do it right."

## SLIDE 18: Esther E. — A Flower of the South (15 minutes)

### This Is the Heart of the History Segment
- "If Kent W. represented the promotional false start, Esther E. represented the spiritual bedrock upon which ALL Dallas AA was built."

### Her Background (paint the picture)
- "Raised in New Orleans. Social drinking was normal — wine with dinner, cordials after. At her own wedding, seeing her nervousness, her father ordered a servant to bring her something to drink. The servant brought a water glass full of bourbon." (Let the room react.)
- "She lived in Dallas 1927 to 1932, trying 'all the doctors, hospitals and cures — the Sanitarium three times.' Then moved to Houston where her drinking continued to escalate."
- "Her bottom? She was arrested while walking the dog. A patrol car saw her staggering."

### The Saturday Evening Post Moment
- "This is where history turns on a pivotal moment. A few weeks before Esther hit bottom, her husband had read the Jack Alexander article in the Saturday Evening Post — March 1, 1941. This is the article that transformed AA from 2,000 members to 8,000 in one year — a quadrupling."

> 📖 Read the husband's ultimatum from screen: *"If you will try this thing, I'll go along with you. If you don't, you will have to go home. I cannot sit by and watch you destroy yourself!"*

- "Esther wrote to the General Service Office. Within a week she received AA literature and a hand-written letter from Ruth Hock. That personal touch, she later said, 'did a lot to help.'"
- "**Esther E.'s sobriety date: May 16, 1941.**"

### The Founding (read with weight)
- "In her second year sober, Esther and her husband transferred to Dallas. She found a vacuum — Kent W.'s effort had evaporated. The phone number Ruth Hock gave her was disconnected."

> 📖 Read the March 29, 1943 letter from screen: *"This is where I had been so sick for five years..."*

- "**On April 2, 1943**, the first meeting of 'The Dallas Group' was held in Esther's home."
- "And here's the beautiful part — **Ruth T. was there.** The woman who wrote that letter seeking help in 1941. Two years of waiting. The seeker and the carrier of the message finally united."
- Pause. Let it land.
- "**This date — April 2, 1943 — marks the lineage point for EVERY AA group in the Dallas metroplex today.** Including yours."

### The Details
- "Meetings were Tuesdays and Fridays at 8 PM. Strictly speaker meetings. Word of mouth only. By 1945, fewer than twenty people were sober in all of Dallas."
- "Esther worked for two years with alcoholics at Terrell State Hospital — the only facility in the area that would accept alcoholics."
- "Her Big Book, inscribed by Bill Wilson, remains at the Dallas Central Office to this day."
- "**Esther E. died June 3, 1960**, with more than nineteen years of continuous sobriety."

### Moment of Silence
- Ask for a brief moment of silence for Esther E.

### Transition
- "From Esther's living room, the fellowship began to grow — and one of its most important figures arrived just three years later."

## SLIDE 19: Searcy W. & the Suburban Group (10 minutes)

### Searcy W.'s Story
- "Searcy Whaley first heard about AA in 1945 from an old drinking buddy. Lost his job in November 1945. Stayed drunk until April 1946. Came to Dallas to find AA."
- "He was placed in a 'drying out place' off Maple Street — the only facility in Dallas that would accept alcoholics. On his third day, someone took him to a meeting at 912½ Main Street."
- "**Sobriety date: May 5, 1946.** He would maintain continuous sobriety for **57 years** until his death in September 2003 — Dallas's oldest known AA member."

### The Suburban Group
- "Just four months after getting sober — September 1946 — Searcy and others founded the **Suburban Group** at Dickason and Sale Streets, near Lee Park."
- "This was pivotal because it was the **first decentralization** of AA from downtown to neighborhoods. It created the prototype for the neighborhood group. AA needed to exist where people lived, not just where they congregated."
- Walk through the offspring groups on screen: Preston, Belmont, Belwood, Central, Town North.

### Ask the Room
- "Does anyone here know which group YOUR home group descended from? Every group has a genealogy."

### Central Office & Dick P.
- "By 1947, with only TWO active groups, local leaders opened the Dallas Central Office — September 18, 1947 — in the Davis Building on Akard Street."
- "The first manager was Dick P., who suffered from 'Jamaica Ginger Paralysis' — Jake Leg — a permanent disability from toxic Prohibition-era alcohol. Despite being unable to walk properly, he managed the phones and coordinated Twelfth Step calls."
- "Establishing a Central Office with only two groups was an act of profound faith."

### Growth Stats (point to screen)
- Walk through: 2 groups → 8 → 30 → 160+ today. "From Esther's living room to over 160 groups."

### Transition
- "But the most remarkable chapter in Dallas AA history involves a name every AA member knows — even if they don't know his Dallas connection."

## SLIDE 20: Ebby Thacher & the Traditions (10 minutes)

### Searcy and the Traditions — Setup
- "Before we get to Ebby, one more Searcy W. story. In 1948, 25 AA members from across Texas met in Lubbock. Searcy arranged for Bill Wilson to attend from Phoenix."
- "On the airplane, Bill showed Searcy his handwritten notes — the original Twelve Traditions."

> 📖 Read Searcy's response: *"We don't need this down here. We love each other."*

- "At the 1950 International Convention — 8,000 to 9,000 people — the Traditions were adopted with no dissenting votes. Dr. Bob and Bill had personally schooled Searcy on the Traditions. He came to understand they weren't restrictions but protections."

### Ebby Thacher — Build It Up
- "How many of you know who Ebby Thacher is?" (Likely many hands.)
- "Ebby is the man who FIRST carried the message to Bill Wilson in November 1934. Without Ebby, there is no Bill W. Without Bill W., there is no AA."
- "But here's what most people don't know: Ebby struggled with sobriety for **EIGHTEEN YEARS** after helping Bill get sober." (Let that number land.)

### The Story
- "In early 1953, Bill Wilson visited Dallas and met with Searcy. When Searcy asked what Bill would most like to see happen in AA, Bill's answer was:"

> 📖 *"I'd rather see Ebby have a chance to get sober."*

- "Mutual friends found Ebby on the Bowery in New York City. Dried him out briefly. And sent him to Dallas — with a pint of whiskey."
- "He arrived at Searcy's clinic in terrible shape — 'cussing out Bill and Dr. Bob and me and everybody else.' Eventually, he asked to attend a meeting."
- Pause. "**He got sober at the Suburban Club.**"
- Let that land. "The same fellowship that had grown from HIS original message to Bill Wilson could later save HIM. That is the miracle of this program."

### Reflection (2 minutes)
- "What does Ebby's story teach us about never giving up on anyone?"
- Let 2-3 people share.

### Transition
- "Now let's put this all together — the bigger picture of how Dallas AA connects to the worldwide fellowship."

- "NETA 65 covers northeast Texas — 29 districts, 512+ groups. We connect to the General Service Conference in New York."

### District 22
- "This is US. District 22. Our groups, our GSRs, our DCM. Through your home group's GSR → District 22 → NETA Area 65 → General Service Conference, YOUR voice reaches all of AA."

## Appendix A: Emergency Scenarios Bank

Use these if you have extra time or want to substitute for planned scenarios:

### Scenario: "The Relapsing Member"
A home group member with 2 years of sobriety relapses. They come back to the meeting, visibly ashamed. Some members welcome them warmly. Others seem uncomfortable. One old-timer says at the business meeting, "Maybe we need to be more careful about who we let share."

**Discussion:** What Traditions apply? (3, 1, 5) What is the group's responsibility? What would your home group do?

### Scenario: "The Non-Alcoholic Attendee"
Someone begins attending your open home group meetings regularly. They share that they're not an alcoholic but have a family member who is. They want to join the group. At the business meeting, a member asks whether this person should be allowed to vote.

**Discussion:** What does Tradition Three say? What's the difference between an open and closed meeting? Can this person be a "member"?

### Scenario: "The Money Question"
Your home group has accumulated $3,000 in its treasury. Some members want to donate it all to the local intergroup. Others say the group should keep a larger prudent reserve. The treasurer suggests sending some to the district, some to NETA 65, and some to GSO.

**Discussion:** What does Tradition Seven say? What does the AA Service Manual suggest about fund flow? What is a "prudent reserve"?

### Scenario: "The Format War"
Half the home group wants to switch from a speaker meeting to a Big Book study. The other half loves the current format. The debate has been going on for three business meetings. Attendance is dropping because people are frustrated.

**Discussion:** How does an informed group conscience handle this? What does Tradition Four allow? Could the group compromise?

### Scenario: "The Online Question"
Since the pandemic, your home group has offered a hybrid option (in-person + Zoom). Some members think the Zoom option should be permanent. Others feel it reduces the quality of fellowship and that "real AA" is in person.

**Discussion:** What does Tradition Four say about group autonomy? What about the 30th Anniversary Edition of "Home Group: Heartbeat" discussing virtual meetings?

### Scenario: "The Anonymous Break"
A home group member posts a photo from the meeting on social media, tagging other members by name. Some members are upset. Others say, "It's just Facebook, relax."

**Discussion:** What do Traditions 11 and 12 say about anonymity? What is the difference between personal anonymity and breaking others' anonymity?
