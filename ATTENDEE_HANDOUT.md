## What Is a Home Group?

> *"Traditionally, most A.A. members through the years have found it important to belong to one group that they call their 'home group.' This is the group where they accept service responsibilities and try to sustain friendships."*
> — P-16 "The A.A. Group...Where It All Begins," page 15

**89% of AA members have a home group** (2022 AA Membership Survey).

Membership is **self-declared**: *"Just as we are members of A.A. if we say we are, so are we members of a group if we say we are."* — P-16, page 13

---

## Home Group vs. Meeting Attendance

The home group provides what casual attendance cannot:

### 1. Accountability & Expectation
> *"Part of my commitment is to show up at my home group meetings, greet newcomers at the door, and be available to them... My fellow group members are the people who know me, listen to me, and steer me straight when I am off in left field."*
> — P-16, member testimonial

### 2. Service Responsibility
> *"A.A.'s take turns doing the services needed for group meetings and other functions... within the A.A. group, these services are easy to do, and they do wonders for us. They build a sturdy backbone for our recovery."*
> — Living Sober, pages 14–15

### 3. Voting Rights & Group Conscience
> *"With membership comes the right to vote on issues that might affect the group and might also affect A.A. as a whole — a process that forms the very cornerstone of A.A.'s service structure."*
> — P-16, pages 15–16

## Why the Home Group Matters — What the Literature Says

### On Unity
> *"THE unity of Alcoholics Anonymous is the most cherished quality our Society has. Our lives, the lives of all to come, depend squarely upon it."*
> — Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, page 129

### On Fellowship
> *"We are people who normally would not mix. But there exists among us a fellowship, a friendliness, and an understanding which is indescribably wonderful."*
> — Alcoholics Anonymous (Big Book), page 17

### On the Group & Individual
> *"The moment Twelfth Step work forms a group, a discovery is made — that most individuals cannot recover unless there is a group. Realization dawns on each member that he is but a small part of a great whole... It becomes plain that the group must survive or the individual will not."*
> — As Bill Sees It, page 9

### On Loneliness
> *"Almost without exception, alcoholics are tortured by loneliness. Even before our drinking got bad and people began to cut us off, nearly all of us suffered the feeling that we didn't quite belong... Life takes on new meaning in A.A."*
> — As Bill Sees It, page 90

### On Working With Others
> *"Practical experience shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive work with other alcoholics."*
> — Alcoholics Anonymous (Big Book), page 89

### On Service as Foundation
> *"Helping others is the foundation stone of your recovery. A kindly act once in a while isn't enough. You have to act the Good Samaritan every day, if need be."*
> — Alcoholics Anonymous (Big Book), page 97

### On the Extended Family
> *"Over the years, the very essence of A.A. strength has remained with our home group, which, for many members, becomes our extended family. Once isolated by our drinking, we find in the home group a solid, continuing support system, friends and, very often, a sponsor."*
> — P-16 "The A.A. Group"

> *"Alcoholics Anonymous has been called an upside-down organization because... the groups are on top and the [service entities] are at the bottom."*
> — AA Service Manual, page S15

**Your GSR is the link.** Through your home group's GSR → District 22 → NETA Area 65 → General Service Conference, YOUR voice reaches all of AA.

## Group Conscience: How It Works

> *"The 'group conscience' is the collective conscience of the group membership and thus represents substantial unanimity on an issue before definitive action is taken."*
> — P-16, pages 28–30

**Five elements of informed group conscience:**
1. **Information Gathering** — All facts presented first
2. **Full Discussion** — Every voice heard, including minority opinions
3. **Deliberation Time** — No rushing on sensitive issues
4. **Avoiding Dominant Voices** — No one person governs
5. **Substantial Unanimity** — More than a simple majority

---

## Sponsorship & the Home Group

From P-15 "Questions and Answers on Sponsorship":

**A sponsor helps newcomers by:**
- Encouraging attendance at a variety of meetings (pp. 7–8)
- Introducing newcomers to other members (p. 12)
- Urging participation in group activities as soon as possible

**Service sponsorship begins in the home group:**
> *"The service sponsor begins by encouraging the member to become active in their home group — coffee, literature, cleanup, attending business or intergroup meetings, etc."*
> — P-15, pages 25–26

---

## Choosing a Home Group — What to Look For

From Living Sober, Chapter 29 (pages 75–81):

**Practical:** Time & location you can make consistently | Format you connect with
**Fellowship:** Members whose recovery inspires you | Potential sponsors available
**Service:** Active GSR and business meetings | Room to grow in responsibility

> *"The home group is where recovery begins; it is where AA members grow up in sobriety by the time-honored process of trial and error, to discover that they can be loved, warts and all."*
> — The Home Group: Heartbeat of AA (Grapevine), Foreword

## Key Quotes to Take Home

> *"Life will take on new meaning. To watch people recover, to see them help others, to watch loneliness vanish, to see a fellowship grow up about you, to have a host of friends — this is an experience you must not miss. Frequent contact with newcomers and with each other is the bright spot of our lives."*
> — Big Book, page 89

> *"Our 12 Steps, when simmered down to the last, resolve themselves into the words love and service."*
> — Dr. Bob's final message, Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers, page 338

> *"Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults to Him and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past. Give freely of what you find and join us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit."*
> — Big Book, page 164

## How AA Got to Dallas & North East Texas

### The Texas Entry: Larry J. & Houston (1940)

- **Larry J. (Larry Jewell)** brought AA to Texas in January 1940, carrying nothing but a Big Book
- He had **never attended a single AA meeting** — his sponsors were Dr. Bob Smith and Clarence Snyder
- On the train to Houston, reading the Big Book, he experienced a spiritual awakening
- **First Houston meeting:** March 15, 1940, at the YWCA Building
- Larry's Houston Press articles (February 8, 1940) became **the first AA pamphlet ever published**
- **April 1, 1940:** Larry wrote "The Texas Prayer," used to open Texas AA meetings for years
- By September 1940, Houston was one of only **9 "secure" AA groups** in the entire United States

### The False Start: Kent W. (1941–1942)

- **Ruth T.** sent the first Dallas inquiry letter to New York on **June 14, 1941**
- **Kent W.** arrived December 1, 1941, calling himself **"Chief Sponsor"**
- First Dallas meeting: **January 7, 1942** at the White Plaza Hotel — 12 attendees, 72 newspaper inquiries
- **The entire effort collapsed.** Kent was "never heard from again"
- **Lesson:** Publicity alone cannot sustain a spiritual fellowship (Traditions 2 & 11)

### The True Foundation: Esther E. (1943)

- Big Book story: **"A Flower of the South"** (pp. 384–392, 3rd Edition)
- **Sobriety date:** May 16, 1941 (Houston) — after reading the Jack Alexander Saturday Evening Post article
- Arrived in Dallas 1943, found Kent W.'s effort had vanished
- **April 2, 1943:** First meeting of "The Dallas Group" in Esther's home — **Ruth T. was present**
- **This date marks the lineage point for EVERY AA group in the Dallas metroplex today**
- By 1945: fewer than 20 people sober in all of Dallas
- Esther's Big Book, **inscribed by Bill Wilson**, remains at the Dallas Central Office
- **Died June 3, 1960** with 19+ years of continuous sobriety

### Post-War Growth (1946–1947)

- **Searcy W. (Whaley)** — sobriety date: May 5, 1946 — 57 years of continuous sobriety until death in 2003
- **September 1946:** Founded the **Suburban Group** (Dickason & Sale Streets, near Lee Park)
  - First decentralization of AA from downtown to neighborhoods
  - Mother group of Preston, Belmont, Belwood, Central, Town North, and many others
- **September 18, 1947:** **Dallas Central Office** opens on Akard Street — with only 2 active groups
  - First manager: **Dick P.** — suffered from "Jamaica Ginger Paralysis" (Jake Leg) from toxic Prohibition-era alcohol

### Ebby Thacher — Bill's Sponsor Saved in Dallas (1953)

- Ebby first carried the message to **Bill Wilson in November 1934** — without Ebby, there is no AA
- Struggled with sobriety for **18 years** after helping Bill get sober
- In 1953, Bill Wilson visited Dallas and told Searcy W.: *"I'd rather see Ebby have a chance to get sober"*
- Friends found Ebby on the Bowery in New York, sent him to Dallas
- **Got sober at the Suburban Club** — the fellowship that grew from his message saved him
- Died March 21, 1966, with 2½ years of sobriety

### Searcy W. & the Twelve Traditions (1948)

> *"We don't need this down here. We love each other."*
> — Searcy W. to Bill Wilson, 1948 (on seeing the handwritten Traditions)

At the 1950 International Convention (8,000–9,000 people), the Traditions were adopted with **no dissenting votes**. Searcy came to understand they weren't restrictions but protections.
